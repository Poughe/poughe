You are what you do, not what you say you will do. 

I am on a relentless pursuit to change the world one project at a time. I have always been motivated by the power of technology and how it can be utilized as a tool for positive changes around the world. I am a Boston-based full-stack software engineer with a military background of over 10 years. Feel free to message me anytime and connect.
